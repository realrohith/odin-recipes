    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Pesto pizza</em></strong> is a traditional Italian Pizza made out of fresh pesto and garnished with some parmesan and cherry tomatoes.
        Pizza without tomato sauce! Yes, we know there are several abominations in the name of pizza, but trust us when we say this is one of the best pizza
        you'll ever taste'. You'll thank us later.'
    </p>
    <p>
        While pizza traditionally has tomato sauce (with the notable exception of Pizza Bianca), pesto just gives the dish a unique kick, be it from the
        freshness of herbs or the nuttiness of pinenuts.

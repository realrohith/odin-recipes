    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious flatbread that goes well with soups and curries, <strong><em>Naan</em></strong> is traditionally baked in a clay oven pot, but this recipe uses handy alternatives.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>100 grams water</li>
        <li>200 grams refined wheat flour</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>a stick of butter</li>
        <li>a teaspoon of sugar</li>
        <li>2 grams Yeast (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the warm water with the yeast and sugar until the yeast is dissolved. Cover and let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl add the yeast mixture, half of the butter and all the yogurt. Mix into a soft dough then knead
            on a floured surface for about 5 minutes or until dough is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a large greased bowl, cover and let stand in a warm
            place for 1 1/2 hours or until the dough is doubled in size.
        </li>
        <li>Punch down dough then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into 2 pieces. Roll each piece out into 8 inch round naans.</li>
        <li>
            Cover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush the naan with a little of the remaining butter and sprinkle with some of the kalonji.
            Cook naan one at a time under the broiler for about 2 minutes on each side or until puffed and just browned.
